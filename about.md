About me:
I'm 24 years old, enjoy anime, memes, and cryptocurrency. I currently live in Northern California near Sacramento, and I like to go fishing on the weekends. I also go to anime conventions. My favorite animes are Neon Genesis Evangelion, King of the Hill, and How It's Made. It's nice to meet you!
