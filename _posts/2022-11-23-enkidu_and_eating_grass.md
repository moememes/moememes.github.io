In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Enkidu was created by the Goddess of creation herself, Aruru. Enkidu was noble, with long hair and innocent of mankind. Enkidu ate grass in the hills with the gazelles and drank water with them at the water-holes. 

One day a young man, a trapper, met Enkidu. And the young man feared him, for Enkidu could not be controlled. Enkidu ate grass with the gazelles and drank water from the water-holes with the lions, and the young man could not offer Enkidu anything of value to get him to stop messing around with his traps. So, he paid a prostitute to have sex with Enkidu. Afterwards, Enkidu found that he could no longer communicate with the beasts and could not eat grass. He had become a man, and has become socialized. He now worked for humans. 

Later on, Enkidu would meet Gilgamesh, be best friends, and then get killed by the Gods for his shenanigans. 

Enkidu's tale represents the lost of nature in the face of civilization. By having sex and interacting with humans, he has lost his ability to eat grass and be in touch with the natural world. Engaging with society means that he has lost his natural abilities to act in his own best faith, and has become a resource, similar to the gazelles he used to live with and the grass he used to consume. 

Social media and culture has done to the terminally online as what the prostitute has done to Enkidu - the terminally online are so oversocialized as to behave against their best interests and instead for the for the interests of those who have tamed them. They have lost the ability to touch and eat grass, just as Enkidu, and now work for the groups of people who they believe are their peers, yet who enslave them. Oversocialization is a modern form of control.

When you're too online, remember to touch some grass (maybe eat it too) and hydrate, as Enkidu did.
