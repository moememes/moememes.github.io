On October 17, the price of a dollar was 0.000258 BTC. 

As of December 17th, 7:37am Pacific Time, the price of a dollar is 0.000059 BTC, the lowest the dollar has ever been. In fact, the dollar has lost almost 80% of its value over the last three to four months.

That means you'll need:

* 1.0 BTC or 16,500 USD to purchase a brand new 2017 Honda Civic LX (if you're good at negotiating)
* 0.000148 BTC or 2.5 USD to purchase two McDoubles at McDonalds
* 0.058941 BTC or 999 USD to purchase the iPhone X 
* 0.000410 BTC or 6.99 USD for a month's worth of anime on Crunchyroll.com

As you can see, it's never been a worse time to purchase the USD, or any other currency. In fact, most of the world's currencies have been losing their value to the BTC. 

The dollar bubble has popped, and it's never been more unwise to buy in.

**EDIT** As of 08:25 PST the USD has fallen even more, to 0.000052 BTC/USD. 

That means you'll need:

1.0 BTC or 19,000 USD to purchase a brand new 2017 Toyota Camry (if you're good at negotiating)

**EDIT2** As of 08:37 PST Coinbase's trading site, GDAX, has crashed but not before the USD reached an even lower all time low at 0.00005 BTC. 

That means you'll need:
1.0 BTC or 20,000 USD to purchase a brand new 2017 Toyota Camry with options (if you're good at negotiating)
