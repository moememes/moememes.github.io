## Thoughts on the Gentrification of Anime

### Now and Then, Here and There
Today, Saturday February 24th in the Year Of Our Lord 2018 Crunchyroll hosts the Anime Awards, a red-carpet event mimicking the prestige of Hollywood's Academy Awards. Bringing dozens of anime culture figureheads and Youtube "influencers," Crunchyroll hopes to expedite anime's journey from the niche hole-in-the-wall pop culture it was to the mainstream culture phenomenon it will be.  

Anime sure has changed. Just a few decades ago, anime was niche culture; you may be shoved into the locker while trying to talk in Klingon to your friends, but that kid who keeps on talking about his Chinese cartoons like Battle Angel and Gall Force, now there's a real loser. 

Flash forward 25 years to 2018. 

There are real, multibillion dollar companies promoting Japanese animation. There are people who make their living by dressing up in their favorite anime character's costumes. One can become e-famous - the bargain bin version of being actually famous - by enjoying the correct anime, pop culture, or fan community. Marilyn Monroe has inspired many a young girl in decades past, but today's youth are more inspired by Jessica Nigri. Anime is now a thing, and anime is great. Yesterdays kids have become today's millenials and today's millenials are unafraid and unashamed to enjoy what they want to enjoy. And anime has prospered, and is in the journey of prospering even further.

### The Story of Quinoa

Quinoa is a grain originated in the Andean region of South America. While quinoa can be grown in other regions, the high altitude requirements and low temperatures that it requires to grow optimally results in the crop being primarily grown in South American countries like Peru, Bolivia, or Ecuador. The farmers in these countries have primarily grown quinoa as a subsistence crop, exporting very little of the grain until recently.

Somewhere around the early-2000's, the White Man, just as how He discoved America and Civilization, discovered quinoa. Health foods were created around this product, marketing themselves to young progressives and millenials. Suddenly, hordes upon hordes of young Americans were buying quinoa at their local supermarkets. At first, the poor South American countries producing quinoa were elated. They suddenly saw their product, something they've had problems selling, jump in market value in just a few years. Overnight, farmers switched from subsistence farming to capitalize on this new cash crop. The White Man had saved their economies. Good, right?

The demand for quinoa outpaced supply. More and more farmers switched their lands to this new cash crop, with the promises of hitting it big in this new gold rush. The price of quinoa spiked exponentially. 

Now quinoa is so expensive that the people of the countries who grow it can't afford to buy their own product. Quinoa's nutrients and benefits are shipped from the brown world to the White world. Sure they get money, but you can't eat that. South Americans now import lesser grains with fewer nutrients, starving its people at the cost of profit. 

### Gentrification, You, and I
Why do I talk about quinoa? It's the classic example of gentrification and whitewashing.

>Gentrification, the process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to middle-class taste. "an area undergoing rapid gentrification"

We have stripped quinoa of its cultural value and disrupted its markets. We have bastardized quinoa. 

We in the west ruin everything. Sushiritos, Tex-Mex, quinoa, Kung Pow Chicken. This is gentrification and whitewashing.

Yet for some reason, we believe we have a right - rather, an obligation - to do the same to anime. Despite what online sentiment was expressed, the Market favored a Death Note Live Action featuring not Light Yagami, but Light Turner, and the Market is all-powerful.
