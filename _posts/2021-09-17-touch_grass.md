I've touched grasses at the top of mountains, where only goats and marmots live. I've touched the grasses under the sea, with all sorts of different colors and textures. I've touched luscious grasses from the most fertile of valleys, full of greenery and life.

I've touched dry, arid grasses from the most desolate of deserts, devoid of water and blown around by the harshest of winds. I've touched grass from all over, different cities, states, countries. I've felt their texture around my toes, the blades around my fingertips.

I can tell the difference easily between the blades of Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and zoysia growing in the field not only by color and feel, but by taste. I've eaten dandelion, clover, and other grass like plants that grow with the grass.

I've plucked wild mushrooms from the grass, sauteed them up, and eaten them. Don't tell me to touch grass, tell yourself to touch grass. And don't just touch the grass. You have to be one with the grass, like me.

You have to understand the grass, be the grass, put yourself in the grass' roots and feel what the grass feels. I've touched grass in many different places, in different seasons, when the grass is tall, when it's short, when it's green, when it's brown. I've touched grass while it's growing, I've touched it when it's dead, I've touched it at the beginning of its life and at the end of it's life.

I've touched grass with all kinds of animals, I've touched grass on land with no animals, I've touched it on land with large amounts of animals, I've touched it with small amounts of animals, I've touched it on land with no animals at all.

I've touched grass with different types of people, I've touched grass while riding in cars and planes, I've touched grass when walking in the snow. I've touched it with people I don't even know, I've touched it with people I know, I've touched it when alone, I've touched it with my family, I've touched it with my friends, and I've touched it with strangers.

I've touched grass on land with different types of people. I've touched it while playing sports. I've touched it when playing sports and I've touched it when not playing sports. I've touched it with the very young, I've touched it with the very old.

I've touched grass in the mountains, and grass in the plains, grass in the oceans, grass in the woods, grass in the snow, grass in the water, grass in the air. I've touched grass in a lot of different places, in a lot of different seasons, and different times of the day.

I've touched grass while the sun is high, and I've touched grass when the sun is low. I've touched it in the snow, when the sun is shining, when the sun is going down, when the sun is setting, when the sun is rising.

I've touched grass in the daylight, I've touched grass in the night, I've touched grass when it's windy, when it's not windy, when it's cold, when it's hot.

I've touched grass in the morning, when the sun is shining brightly, when it's fading, when it's at sunset.

I've touched grass in the spring, when it's springtime. I've touched grass in the summer, when it's summer. I've touched grass in the fall, when it's fall. I've touched grass in the winter, when it's winter.

I've touched grass while it's green, I've touched grass when it's brown. I've touched grass when it's growing, I've touched grass when it's dead. I've touched grass at the beginning of its life, and I've touched it at the end of its life.

And I've touched it, felt it, understood it, loved it, and hated it.

I've touched grass.

There you go.
