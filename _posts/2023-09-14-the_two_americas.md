"America stands divided." But what's the dividing line? Some might point to politics. Others may argue it's ideology or even geography. Articles keep popping up, trying to dissect the "Two Americas" at their core, but they often overlook the intricate web of interconnecting cultures, policies, demographics, and environments that fuel this division.

In the realm of science and research, we often seek to explain phenomena through causal studies. A correlational study just doesn't pack the same punch as a causal one. No one's rushing to publish your work until they grasp why that correlation exists. The pressure to overfit our models can be overwhelming. However, instead of trying to pinpoint the root differences of the Two Americas, why not define them by their symptoms?

There indeed exist Two Americas. In one, you'll find places, regions, towns, and cities where public bathrooms are as plentiful as they are free. Need to relieve yourself? It's a no-brainer; just step into a McDonald's or Starbucks, and you're good to go – no secret code, no purchase required. The restrooms might not be pristine, sure; there could be water puddles around the sink, and the toilet paper might be of the single-ply variety, but hey, it's free. You're free to do your business without interaction or inquiry. You can sip from your gym bag's water bottle without a second thought, munch away, and carry on with your day, unburdened by thoughts of tummy discomfort or mapping out the nearest public restroom in a park using Google Maps. Restrooms are so ubiquitous in your life that you don't even think twice about them.

Now, shift your gaze to the other America, where public restrooms aren't so charitable. Need to go? Brace yourself for a strategic operation. You might plan your restroom breaks around establishments where you're a paying customer. You could find yourself holding it in until lunchtime, forgoing that water bottle in your bag, or opting for a lighter meal to avoid the inevitable restroom hunt. Sometimes, you'll spot a McDonald's or Starbucks, only to discover that their restrooms are exclusively for paying patrons. In such moments, you reluctantly purchase a coffee just to score a restroom code. And when local laws mandate public restroom access, you might just encounter the "out of order" sign at the most inconvenient times.

The need to answer nature's call is a universal one (unless you're perpetually dehydrated). Yet, the barriers to doing so are all too familiar in the second America. Those in the first America hardly notice these challenges.

Now, consider this scenario: pluck a man from the First America and drop him into the Second America, and you've got a recipe for frustration. He'll question why he can't simply use a McDonald's restroom without the prerequisite McChicken purchase. He'll grumble about every closed restroom he stumbles upon. Nevertheless, he'll adapt; he'll ration his water intake and carry hand sanitizer for those sketchy park restrooms. It'll be bewildering at first, but he'll soldier on.

On the flip side, transplant a Second America resident into the First America, and brace for shock. They'll raise an eyebrow at the sight of a clean, open McDonald's restroom. Their initial confusion at the concept of freely accessible restrooms will fade as they gradually embrace the idea. Unconsciously, they'll start drinking water more liberally, and while there might be some initial befuddlement, they'll eventually find their footing.

The dichotomy between these two Americas isn't just a matter of restroom availability; it's also a reflection of the mindset ingrained in the citizens of each realm.

In the America blessed with abundant public restrooms, a sense of convenience and entitlement often prevails. People move about their daily lives without the burden of restroom-related worries. They hydrate without a second thought, snack whenever the urge strikes, and navigate their day without the constant awareness of the nearest bathroom's location. This freedom from restroom constraints not only impacts daily routines but also influences attitudes towards consumption, hydration, and even the acceptance of discomfort. In this America, the notion of "freedom" extends beyond the political realm into the realm of bodily functions, where personal needs can be addressed without hesitation or constraint.

Contrastingly, the Second America, where public restrooms are scarce and often locked behind purchase barriers, fosters a mindset of restraint and calculation. Residents here must carefully plan their restroom breaks, consider their liquid intake, and strategize around meal times. The constant juggling act between hydration, nutrition, and the impending need for a restroom influences how they approach their daily routines. This mindset reinforces the idea that certain basic needs, like answering nature's call, must be earned or planned for, and it often results in individuals unconsciously suppressing their physiological requirements to avoid inconvenience or embarrassment.

But more than anything, it reflects on the mindset of each person's view of America as a whole. First America citizens see their America as a land of convenience and opportunity. They take great pride in their America. Second America citizens see their America as a land of inconvenience and struggle. They view their America with a lens of shame. 

For citizens of the First America, their land is one of boundless pride. They take immense pride in the accessibility and freedom of their public restrooms, seeing them as emblematic of the American spirit – a land where convenience and liberty are paramount. In their eyes, this privilege extends beyond restroom access; it represents an entire way of life, where needs are met with ease, and obstacles are minimal. This perspective often translates into an unshakeable faith in the nation's ability to overcome challenges and a sense of entitlement to the comforts of life.

Conversely, for citizens of the Second America, there's often a sense of shame associated with their restroom predicament. They view their limited restroom access as emblematic of a broader systemic failure, where inequality and inequity loom large. They may carry a sense of embarrassment or even resentment towards a society that doesn't ensure equal access to something as basic as a restroom. This shame can extend to their perception of the nation as a whole, seeing it as a place where fundamental needs are not universally guaranteed and where systemic issues persist.

These mindsets are self-fulfilling. In the First America, citizens take immense pride in their easy access to public restrooms. They take for granted things that should be taken for granted, and strive to make their America one where these things can continue to be taken for granted. Anything that attempts to reduce their access to free restrooms is an attack on their America. They live their lives with this freedom. So they work hard to maintain these freedom. They maintain order, cleanliness, civility, trust. They assert that people, like them, are good. They assume that people who use the public restroom are good. The thought of committing an act that removes these benefits for First America is disgusting and almost unimaginable.

In the Second America, the citizen feels helpless. They have to bend their lives to the powers which control the restrooms. Their entire lives are structured in a way where they are constantly reminded of their helplessness. This reduces their agency. They accept that their America will never have free restrooms, and live their lives under the control of the bathroom key. They accept that they will never have the free use toilets. They do not care about the maintenance of order, cleanliness, civility, or trust. They assume that there will be people who destroy these toilets, and assert that they can never be free due to the drugs and destruction that happens around them. If someone shoots up in a McDonalds bathroom, oh well - it's just a fact of life.

This stark contrast in attitudes towards public restroom access fuels a spiral in each of the Americas. In the First America, any act of violence or disruption that threatens restroom accessibility is met with outrage and condemnation. However, in the Second America, similar actions often go unnoticed or are met with apathy. This glaring disparity in responses to public restroom-related crimes further deepens the divide between these Two Americas. 

These Two Americas transcend rural and urban boundaries, racial and ethnic ties, and income levels. The availability of public restrooms in each America isn't determined by a single causal factor but rather by a multitude of factors. However, more crucial than the actual availability of public restrooms is the reflection of the mentality of the residents in each America. It's the contrast between a mentality of possibility and one of hopelessness that truly defines these that divide.
